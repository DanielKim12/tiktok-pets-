TikTokPets Selection Algorithm
Overview
The TikTokPets Selection Algorithm is a feature implemented to enhance user experience by providing personalized video recommendations based on viewed count. This algorithm leverages the TikTok API to gather data and make intelligent selections, seamlessly integrating with both the backend and frontend of the application.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Users are presented with video suggestions tailored to their preferences, determined by the number of views.
TikTok API Integration: The algorithm utilizes the TikTok API to fetch data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date recommendations.
Backend and Frontend Integration: The selection process is seamlessly integrated into both the backend and frontend components of the application, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
Implementation Details
Backend
API Integration: The backend communicates with the TikTok API to fetch video data, including view counts and other relevant metrics.
Data Processing: Upon receiving data from the TikTok API, the backend processes it to identify trending videos based on view counts.
API Endpoints: Custom API endpoints are created to serve the processed video recommendations to the frontend.
Frontend
Display of Recommendations: The frontend component of the application displays the personalized video recommendations to users.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the recommendations, providing feedback that may further refine future selections.
Responsive Design: The frontend interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.
Getting Started
To integrate the TikTokPets Selection Algorithm into your project, follow these steps:

API Configuration: Obtain API credentials from TikTok and configure them in the backend component of your application.
Backend Setup: Set up the necessary routes and controllers to fetch data from the TikTok API and process it.
Frontend Integration: Implement the frontend components to display the personalized video recommendations to users.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the algorithm provides accurate and relevant recommendations.
Deployment: Deploy the updated application with the integrated TikTokPets Selection Algorithm to production.
